# MathFun
The project is aimed to find an exponent and the root of the 4 such that it produces the desired number which is given by the user.NOTE: the number is rounded to the integer when the operations are made
EX: in case the user inputs 2 the exponent for 4 is 1 and the root is 2 since 4 to the power of 1/2 is 2.
